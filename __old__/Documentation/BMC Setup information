To be documented later.

* Deformable mirror

** Software download

The SDK can be downloaded directly from the Boston Micromachines website:
https://bostonmicromachines.com/DMSDK/BMC-DMSDK.zip

It is because of this SDK that we are still tied to this somewhat "old" version of Linux Ubuntu.

The successful installation of this addds stuff in the =/opt/Boston Micromachines/= directory.

Also, you can check that a new Linux kernel module is indeed being loaded now:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lsmod | grep bmc
#+END_SRC

should output the following:

=bmc_mdrv         16384  0=

** Support configuration files

Each BMC DM (it is also true for the four Asgard BMC mirrors) is refered to by a 11-digit serial number.

For the PHOTONICS (ex KERNEL) bench, this number is: *27BW007#051*

According to the BMC documentation, there are two files that came with the DM that must be dropped in the right locations:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

sudo cp 27BW007#051.dm /opt/Boston\ Micromachines/Profiles/

sudo cp LUT_27BW007#051.mat /opt/Boston\ Micromachines/Calibration/

#+END_SRC

From what I can tell, only the "profile" file is really mandatory. The other one might only be usable by people running Matlab?

** Native Test scripts

In the =/opt/Boston\ Micromachines/bin/= directory, there is a litle collection of command lines tools that one can use to double check successful communication with the DM. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
/opt/Boston\ Micromachines/bin/BmcExampleC -s 27BW007#051
#+END_SRC

Goes through a sequence of actuator activation.
